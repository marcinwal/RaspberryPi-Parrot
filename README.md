## Parrot APP

This is a small application for RaspberryPi to track parrots in my garden.
Initially it was comparing pictures to spot changes and trigger some actions.

Solution worked but was not optimal as the level of light also triggers some actions.
I changed my initial idea to use move sensors to trigger the camera and send pictures to twitter.

##To do:

- attach sensor to PI
- attach 2 servos to move the camera

##Bigger to do:

- use AI to recognize the birds coming (using openCV or other technologies)
